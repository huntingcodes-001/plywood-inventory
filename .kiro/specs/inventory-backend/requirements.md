# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a complete Python backend API for an inventory management system. The backend will replace the current localStorage-based data management in the React frontend and provide secure, role-based access control with proper data persistence using Supabase PostgreSQL database.

## Glossary

- **Inventory_Management_System**: The complete web application consisting of React frontend and Python backend API
- **API_Server**: The Python FastAPI backend server that handles all business logic and data operations
- **Supabase_Database**: The PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase used for data persistence
- **JWT_Token**: JSON Web Token used for user authentication and authorization
- **RBAC_System**: Role-Based Access Control system that enforces permissions based on user roles
- **Admin_User**: User with 'admin' role having full system access
- **Salesperson_User**: User with 'salesperson' role limited to order creation and viewing
- **Warehouse_Manager_User**: User with 'warehouse_manager' role managing inventory and order fulfillment
- **Invited_User**: User record with 'invited' status awaiting registration completion
- **Active_User**: User record with 'active' status able to authenticate and use the system

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to have a secure authentication system, so that only authorized users can access the inventory management system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid email and password credentials, THE API_Server SHALL return a JWT_Token containing user_id and role information
2. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials or inactive account, THE API_Server SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized error with appropriate message
3. THE API_Server SHALL use bcrypt hashing for all password storage and verification operations
4. WHEN a JWT_Token is provided in API requests, THE API_Server SHALL validate the token and extract user identity and role information
5. THE API_Server SHALL reject requests with invalid, expired, or missing JWT_Token with 401 Unauthorized error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to invite new users to the system, so that salespersons and warehouse managers can register and access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Admin_User creates a user invitation with email and role, THE API_Server SHALL create an Invited_User record with status 'invited'
2. THE API_Server SHALL validate that invited user role is either 'salesperson' or 'warehouse_manager'
3. WHEN an Admin_User requests user list, THE API_Server SHALL return all users with both 'invited' and 'active' status
4. WHEN an Admin_User deletes a user, THE API_Server SHALL remove the user record from the database
5. THE API_Server SHALL prevent duplicate email addresses in user invitations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an invited user, I want to complete my registration, so that I can activate my account and access the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Invited_User submits registration with valid email, THE API_Server SHALL verify the email exists with 'invited' status
2. IF no invited user exists with the email, THEN THE API_Server SHALL return 403 Forbidden error with message "This email is not authorized to register"
3. WHEN registration data is valid, THE API_Server SHALL update the existing user record with provided details and change status to 'active'
4. THE API_Server SHALL validate password meets requirements: minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
5. THE API_Server SHALL validate phone numbers contain only 10-14 digits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin or warehouse manager, I want to manage inventory items, so that I can maintain accurate stock levels and product information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any authenticated user requests inventory list, THE API_Server SHALL return all inventory items with current stock and threshold information
2. WHEN Admin_User or Warehouse_Manager_User creates inventory item, THE API_Server SHALL add new item to database with provided details
3. WHEN Admin_User or Warehouse_Manager_User updates inventory item, THE API_Server SHALL modify existing item details or stock levels
4. THE API_Server SHALL prevent Salesperson_User from creating or updating inventory items
5. THE API_Server SHALL validate all inventory data including positive stock levels and thresholds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a salesperson, I want to create customer orders, so that I can process customer requests and manage sales.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Salesperson_User creates an order, THE API_Server SHALL validate requested quantities against available inventory stock
2. IF insufficient stock exists for any item, THEN THE API_Server SHALL reject the order with appropriate error message
3. WHEN order validation passes, THE API_Server SHALL atomically create order record and decrease inventory stock levels
4. THE API_Server SHALL prevent order creation by users other than Salesperson_User
5. THE API_Server SHALL assign unique order identifiers and timestamps to new orders

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a warehouse manager or admin, I want to update order status, so that I can track order fulfillment progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Warehouse_Manager_User or Admin_User updates order status, THE API_Server SHALL modify the order status in database
2. THE API_Server SHALL validate status values are 'pending', 'processing', or 'fulfilled'
3. WHEN any authenticated user requests order details, THE API_Server SHALL return complete order information including items
4. THE API_Server SHALL prevent Salesperson_User from updating order status
5. THE API_Server SHALL maintain order history and timestamps for status changes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want role-based access control, so that users can only perform actions appropriate to their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Server SHALL enforce Admin_User access to all endpoints and operations
2. THE API_Server SHALL restrict Salesperson_User to order creation and viewing operations only
3. THE API_Server SHALL allow Warehouse_Manager_User access to inventory management and order fulfillment operations
4. WHEN unauthorized role attempts restricted operation, THE API_Server SHALL return 403 Forbidden error
5. THE API_Server SHALL validate JWT_Token role claims for all protected endpoints

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want data validation and security, so that the system maintains data integrity and prevents security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Server SHALL validate all input data including email format, password strength, and phone number format
2. THE API_Server SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks
3. THE API_Server SHALL implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive system information
4. THE API_Server SHALL log security events including failed authentication attempts
5. THE API_Server SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Supabase integration and database management, so that I can leverage cloud database capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Server SHALL connect to Supabase PostgreSQL database using provided credentials
2. THE API_Server SHALL include SQL migration scripts to create database schema with proper foreign key constraints
3. THE API_Server SHALL include database seeding script to create default Admin_User with email 'admin@admin.com'
4. THE API_Server SHALL use Supabase Python client for database operations and connection management
5. THE API_Server SHALL handle Supabase connection failures gracefully with proper error handling

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear setup instructions, so that I can configure the Supabase integration properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Server SHALL require Supabase project URL and service role key as environment variables
2. THE API_Server SHALL provide setup documentation for Supabase project configuration
3. THE API_Server SHALL include instructions for running database migrations and seeding
4. THE API_Server SHALL validate Supabase connection on application startup
5. THE API_Server SHALL provide clear error messages for missing or invalid Supabase configuration
