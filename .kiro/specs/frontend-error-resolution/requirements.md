# Frontend Error Resolution Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic resolution of TypeScript and React compilation errors in the PlywoodPro inventory management system frontend. The system currently has over 1000+ TypeScript errors preventing proper compilation and development workflow.

## Glossary

- **Frontend_System**: The React-based user interface application located in the `src` directory
- **TypeScript_Compiler**: The TypeScript compiler that validates and transpiles TypeScript code
- **React_Runtime**: The React JSX runtime that handles JSX transformation
- **Module_Resolution**: The process by which TypeScript resolves import statements
- **Lucide_Icons**: The icon library used throughout the application for UI elements

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript compiler to properly resolve React imports, so that I can develop and build the application without module resolution errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript compiler processes React imports, THE Frontend_System SHALL resolve all React module dependencies without errors
2. WHEN the TypeScript compiler processes React-DOM imports, THE Frontend_System SHALL resolve all React-DOM module dependencies without errors
3. WHEN the TypeScript compiler processes JSX syntax, THE Frontend_System SHALL properly transform JSX using the React runtime
4. THE Frontend_System SHALL maintain all existing React component functionality after resolution
5. THE Frontend_System SHALL preserve all existing TypeScript type safety after resolution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all JSX elements to have proper type definitions, so that TypeScript can validate component props and element attributes correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript compiler encounters JSX elements, THE Frontend_System SHALL provide proper type definitions for all intrinsic elements
2. WHEN the TypeScript compiler encounters React component props, THE Frontend_System SHALL validate prop types correctly
3. WHEN the TypeScript compiler encounters event handlers, THE Frontend_System SHALL provide proper event type definitions
4. THE Frontend_System SHALL eliminate all "JSX element implicitly has type 'any'" errors
5. THE Frontend_System SHALL maintain strict type checking for all React components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Lucide React icon library to be properly resolved, so that all UI icons display correctly without import errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript compiler processes Lucide React imports, THE Frontend_System SHALL resolve all icon component dependencies
2. WHEN React renders icon components, THE Frontend_System SHALL display all icons correctly in the UI
3. THE Frontend_System SHALL maintain all existing icon functionality across all pages
4. THE Frontend_System SHALL preserve all icon styling and positioning
5. THE Frontend_System SHALL eliminate all Lucide React module resolution errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all implicit 'any' type errors resolved, so that the codebase maintains strict TypeScript type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript compiler encounters function parameters, THE Frontend_System SHALL provide explicit type definitions
2. WHEN the TypeScript compiler encounters event handlers, THE Frontend_System SHALL provide proper event parameter types
3. WHEN the TypeScript compiler encounters array methods, THE Frontend_System SHALL provide proper callback parameter types
4. THE Frontend_System SHALL eliminate all "Parameter implicitly has an 'any' type" errors
5. THE Frontend_System SHALL maintain existing functionality while adding proper types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to complete successfully, so that I can deploy the application to production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the build command, THE Frontend_System SHALL compile all TypeScript files without errors
2. WHEN running the development server, THE Frontend_System SHALL start without compilation errors
3. WHEN running type checking, THE Frontend_System SHALL pass all TypeScript validation
4. THE Frontend_System SHALL maintain all existing application functionality after error resolution
5. THE Frontend_System SHALL preserve all existing user interface behavior and styling
